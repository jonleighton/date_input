Version 1.1.1
-------------

 * Bugfix - Make the stringToDate function a bit more forgiving. Previously
   it wouldn't accept international characters in the month name (e.g. Mär)
   Now the month name is only required to be a positive number of non-space
   characters. [Heads up: Arne-Kolja Bachstein]

Version 1.1
-----------

 * Localise the $ function for the whole plugin, for better compatibility
 * Add an options argument, a simple way to customise or localise the plugin
 * Add a start_of_week option and make the code more general to accomodate this
 * Hide the date selector if a click is detected anywhere within the window, not
   just in the body of the document (only for browsers which support window.onclick)

Version 1.0
-----------

 * Initial release
