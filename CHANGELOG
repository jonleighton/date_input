Version 1.2.2
-------------

 * Fix for jQuery 1.5

Version 1.2.1
-------------

 * Fix CSS bug with WebKit-based browsers

Version 1.2.0
-------------

 * Implement better keyboard navigation via arrow keys, Pg-Up, Pg-Down, Esc, etc [Adapted from a
   patch by Kevin Field]
 * Implement year scrolling, as well as month scrolling
 * Use XML entities for compatibility
 * Use position rather than offset to determine whether a click is inside or outside of the date

Version 1.1.8
-------------

 * Implement fix for reported crash in IE6/7 (see http://plugins.jquery.com/node/5937) [thanks
   Olly Hodgson]

Version 1.1.7
-------------

 * Solve weird issue with duplicate and missing days in certain time zones (#2984,
   thanks to Arsenicus)
 * Insert the date picker directly after the input, so that the links in it can be
   tabbed through. Listen for the Esc key and hide the date picker if it's pressed (#2276)

Version 1.1.6
-------------

 * Remove the requirement for the dimensions plugin, which is included in
   jQuery 1.2.6

Version 1.1.5
-------------

 * Bugfix - In IE 6, the iframe layer had a great z-index than the actual calendar,
   so would obstruct it from view (#2683)

Version 1.1.4
-------------

 * Moved the z-index and other CSS declarations from the Javascript into the CSS
   file for easier customisation (#1521)
 * Bugfix - The current month should always be stored using the first day so we
   can be sure that day exists when the month is changed (#1717)

Version 1.1.3
-------------

 * Bugfix - Customisations (translations etc.) now work in IE 6/7 [Heads up:
   Christian Jarhult]

Version 1.1.2
-------------

 * Bugfix - Manually trigger a change event on the input when we change its
   value. [Heads up: Arne-Kolja Bachstein]
 * Bugfix - Don't allow IE6 select lists to show through. This was supposed to
   work but I obviously neglected my testing duties! [Heads up: kgmiller]

Version 1.1.1
-------------

 * Bugfix - Make the stringToDate function a bit more forgiving. Previously
   it wouldn't accept international characters in the month name (e.g. MÃ¤r)
   Now the month name is only required to be a positive number of non-space
   characters. [Heads up: Arne-Kolja Bachstein]

Version 1.1
-----------

 * Localise the $ function for the whole plugin, for better compatibility
 * Add an options argument, a simple way to customise or localise the plugin
 * Add a start_of_week option and make the code more general to accomodate this
 * Hide the date selector if a click is detected anywhere within the window, not
   just in the body of the document (only for browsers which support window.onclick)

Version 1.0
-----------

 * Initial release
